        <p> Hi! I'm still working on this website. Will be updated in 2022 December/January 2023. </p>

        <p> Hello, my name is Michael and this is my website! I'm studying a Bachelor of Science in Games Development at UTS. This website was made during my first year studying a subject called "Web Systems". In this website, you can see what I've been working on, what I've made, my life and contact details.</p>

            <h1>My Recent Artwork</h1>
        </div>

         <div class="indeximageA">
            <img src="p1.jpg" alt="Man in a White Room on a couch with a table in front of him." width="600" height="400">
        </div>
        <p> This artwork was created in the video game, Garry's Mod. I created it back in 2018. It is called, "A Man in a White Room", and I never really thought of it, I just created it for fun. But looking back now, it actually has meaning behind it.</p>
        
        <div class="indeximageA">
            <img src="s3.jpg" alt="A desert with trees. A chair with 2 bottles on the seat. A crate pallete is on the ground with fruit on top of it." width="600" height="400">
        </div>
        <p> This artwork was also made in Garry's Mod. I created it back in 2019. This one was called, "Deserted Trees". There are two bottles on a chair with a crate pallete and some crates next to them. On that pallete is some fruits. They are surrounded by trees and are in a desert. I think I was depicting a vacation with this one.</p>
