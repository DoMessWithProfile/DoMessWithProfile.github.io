            <h1>My High School Life</h1>
        </div>

            <p>So, high school. My experience was good, for a usual high school experience.</p> 
            <p>The teachers were great, and I think I learned at least something from there. For my last 2 years in high school I studied Mathematics Standard, Chemistry, Physics, Investigating Science, Standard English and Software Design and Development. You can probably guess I was really into Science, and I was. Up until Year 12, I dropped Physics because it got too complex with all the formulas, and Chemistry got really hard with theory. 
            <p>I think I did alright for my high school life.</p>

            <h1>How Did I Get To UTS</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Okay, so most people would have applied through UAC to get to their university, and each course requires an ATAR score. 
        <p>Well, while I was in Year 10 in High School, I was given the opportunity to take an alternative pathway into a university called UTS. It was called U@Uni Academy. To be honest, I only knew that I was signing up for a 2 week workshop where we picked a faculty and created a project within that faculty. They did say I would of been given an offer into university at the end of this whole thing, but I was more interested in the stuff that I would be going to do for the next 3 years. So I did that workshop and I worked with a small team to make a documentary under Communications/Media. I still wonder where that documentary is. I then did a hackathon all about IT and Science. </p>      
        <p>After the HSC, I applied through UTS and they gave me the offer with no ATAR required!</p>
