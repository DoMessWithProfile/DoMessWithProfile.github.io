            <h1>My Plans In The Future</h1>
        </div>

        <p>In the <span class="blue-text"><b>FUTURE</b></span> I plan on going through all 3 years at UTS, graduating and succeeding in my Games Development course. I will probably start working on a game during my second year though. It will either be a visual novel or a tycoon game. After I make my first game, I'll end up publishing it myself and then see where that takes me. I don't want to work at a company under someone, I rather become an indie-developer. But, if I do get a chance to work somewhere big, I will take it I guess.</p>

        <p>Here's my plan:</p>

        <ul>
            <li id="success">Graduate university</li>
            <li id="money">Make a successful game</li>
            <li id="recycle">Make more successful games</li>
        </ul>

            <h1>The Future of Video Game Ideas</h1>
        </div>

        <p>The Video Game industry is doing really well, but there is a slowly upcoming issue where ideas for a video game have already been created. For example Tetris now has a version where you can verse 99 other people. There are also physics versions of Tetris. There's also a game where every move you make plays with the background music. This problem also affects other genres, like Puzzle games. There are perspective, logical, platformer, code, match 3, escape rooms and musical.</p>

        <p>I would say there's still more combinations, but you've seen what happens when a game booms in popularity. More games like that game are developed and made. Plus, they all cover different mechanics so they're a little different. Then boom, that genre has all these twists/combinations. For example, Battle Royale with Fortnite, Apex Legends, Player Unknown Battlegrounds and Fall Guys. A big one is social deduction because there are so many tabletop games and online games that involve social deduction. An example of a tabletop social deduction game is One Night Ultimate Warewolf. An example of an online video game would be Among Us.</p>

        <p>I have about 9 game ideas that haven't been created yet, so I'm ready for the next 25 years if I ever want to make games.</p>
